# MI-Dropout-Can-Be-All-You-Need
This is a code about MI-Dropout which can be used in DNN.This will contain two parts: one is a comparison test code including MNIST dataset, CIFAR10 dataset and CIFAR100 dataset. **The other is the main code based on MI-Dropout.**

## Comparison test code
Each block in this section consists of a **basic.py, a replica of the Dropout module, a downloaded dataset, and a jupyter notebook.**  
**The shell code:** `!python basic.py --method <dataset> --epoch <number>`   
*<dataset> can be MNIST/CIFAR10/CIFAR100 and <number> can be 10 or other numbers.*

## MI-Dropout
**The shell code:** `!python MI.py --method MNIST --epoch 10`  
**This method and epoch can also be changed as Comparison test code.**
